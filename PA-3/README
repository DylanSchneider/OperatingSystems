multi-lookup.c - multi-threaded driver file for resolution.
util.c - DNS resolution function.
queue.c - Simple FIFO queue data structure.
namesX.txt - Input files with domain names seperated by a newline.


---Executables---
multi-lookup - Multi-Threaded DNS Resolution Engine
This program creates a reader thread for each input file, and a resolver thread for each logical cpu on your system. It reads the input files, which contain domain names (separated by \n), and writes the domain and all available IPv4 addresses associated with each domain name. This engine only works for IPv4, if the domain has an IPv6 it will be written at “IPv6-UNHANDLED”.

---Examples---
Build:
 make

Clean:
 make clean

Run:
./multi-threadedDNS names1.txt names2.txt names3.txt names4.txt names5.txt out.txt

Check Memory:
valgrind ./multi-threadedDNS names1.txt names2.txt names3.txt names4.txt names5.txt out.txt
